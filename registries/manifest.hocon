    # Refer to this document for neuro-san specifications for the agent manifest.hocon file 
    # that is used as configuration for neuro-san servers
    # https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san/blob/main/docs/manifest_hocon_reference.md

    # For all the grouped registries such as basic, tools, industry, we include the respective manifest file.

    # Basic examples
    include "registries/basic/manifest.hocon",

    # Tool integration examples
    include "registries/tools/manifest.hocon",
    
    # Industry use cases
    include "registries/industry/manifest.hocon",

    # Experimental and research
    include "registries/experimental/manifest.hocon",

    # Generated agent networks
    include "registries/generated/manifest.hocon",

    # Currently we list each hocon file we want to serve as a key with a boolean value.
    # Eventually we might have a dictionary value with server specifications for each.

    # Agent network designer family of agents

    "agent_network_designer.hocon": true,
    "agent_network_editor.hocon": {
        # This is a support network for agent_network_designer
        # We want it served up, but not listed as a public agent network
        "serve": true,
        "public": false
    },
    "agent_network_instructions_editor.hocon": {
        # This is a support network for agent_network_designer
        # We want it served up, but not listed as a public agent network
        "serve": true,
        "public": false

    },

    # This agent network performs the following actions:
    # 1. Calls "agent_network_designer" as an external agent to generate a .hocon configuration file.
    # 2. Uses the "agent_network_html_generator" tool (from the toolbox) to create an HTML visualization of the network.
    # 3. Demonstrates how the generated network works by calling the coded tool "NsflowSelenium".
    # 4. Sends an email with the .hocon and HTML files attached using the "gmail_with_attachment" tool (also from the toolbox).
    #
    # Requirements:
    # - neuro-san>=0.5.38
    # - Install Gmail support:
    #     pip install -U langchain-google-community\[gmail\]
    # - Set up Gmail API credentials:
    #     Follow the instructions at
    #     https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/quickstart/python#authorize_credentials_for_a_desktop_application
    #     Then download the `credentials.json` file and place it at the top level of this repo.
    # - Install Selenium and WebDriver Manager:
    #     pip install selenium webdriver-manager
    #
    # Additional setup for running the "NsflowSelenium" coded tool:
    # - Start the nsflow service in a separate terminal.
    # - Use non-default ports for the neuro-san HTTP and nsflow servers.
    #   The default ports are 8080 for HTTP and 4173 for nsflow.
    #   For example, you can run:
    #     python -m run --server-http-port 8081 --nsflow-port 4174
